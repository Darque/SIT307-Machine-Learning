<h5>The Learner, Environment, Observations and Actions are the 4 major players in reinforcement learning</h5>

<h1>Reinforcement learning</h1>
</div>
<div>
<p>Reinforcement learning is another important type of machine learning algorithm.</p>
<p>In this algorithm, an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and learning from&nbsp;<em>interactions</em>. Learning from “interaction with the environment” replicates the way humans learn by instinct, curiosity and experimentation.</p>
<p>The learner (a machine or a human) acts on its environment, receives some evaluation based on its action (reward), but is not told which action is the correct one for a desired end goal. The learner’s actions affect the data it receives later.</p>
<p>There are many logic games like Chess, with a sequence of decisions. It is possible to train an agent to learn how to play Chess by reinforcement learning; if the actions and the corresponding rewards are well defined. For example, if I move my Queen out to a vulnerable square, it gets taken off the board. I lose. Next time I’ll try something different.</p>

<p>Other than applications in&nbsp;<em>games</em>, can you find an example where reinforcement learning is used in machine learning? Justify you answer.</p>
