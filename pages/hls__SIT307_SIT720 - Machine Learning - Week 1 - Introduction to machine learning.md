			- Consider how humans learn and make decisions. We analyse data, ﬁnd patterns and use those patterns to make decisions or to predict the outcome of future events. For example, if you buy a car, you might look up reviews, check the features of different models, think about how you want to use the car, take some test drives and then make a choice.

It’s as though you have to choose the perfect vehicle for every person at Deakin.

			- Let’s assume that we have been asked to research a problem and make a decision. You must have access to information (data) from which you can learn. Once you have data, what do you do with it? Most people analyse the information to ﬁnd patterns and relationships. You make a decision based on your work. Finally, you evaluate the model. Did you make a good decision or could it have been better?

			- **Data Cleaning** - Once the data is properly stored, any redundant, noisy, unusable parts of it should be trimmed. Data cleaning is a major step as real-world datasets are highly affected by noise, redundancy and missing values. We might delete any three-wheeled cars because they’re so unusual.

We know the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. In other words, we know the ‘right’ answers so we can select, manipulate and reﬁne features to train the machine.

					- As you can see on the left, in some less complex cases a linear decision boundary can solve the classiﬁcation problem. However as illustrated on the right, more complex cases, require complicated decision boundaries.

				- **Regression** - Another example of supervised learning, is regression. The overall idea of regression is to examine the relationship between response variables and one or more predictor variables. This examination can result in a hyperplane, representing the regression analysis. The following ﬁgure, illustrates a regression problem in 2 dimensions.
