		- The 1959 deﬁnition below makes Machine Learning (ML) seem like magic - “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed,” (Samuel 1959)

			- “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E,”(Mitchell 1997, p. 2)

			- This is an elaborated, perhaps overly complicated deﬁnition of how a computer program learns. It learns only when performance improves with experience. So, what is experience? It is the data that we provide for the machine to process.

			- Experience E, is the information the machine processes using the tasks T, to get closer to what you want to produce, the performance measure P. If the machine continues to perform the tasks but produces rubbish then it hasn’t learned.

			- Consider how humans learn and make decisions. We analyse data, ﬁnd patterns and use those patterns to make decisions or to predict the outcome of future events. For example, if you buy a car, you might look up reviews, check the features of different models, think about how you want to use the car, take some test drives and then make a choice.

			- So why do we need ML? It is all about the volume of data available to us. There is so much information that we cannot make sense of it. It’s as though you have to choose the perfect vehicle for every person at Deakin. It would be a massive task to know what every person wants and needs and to add all the details of various models of vehicle in order to make good decisions.

			- Robots are going to be our companions in the future. They will do our cleaning, cooking and vacuuming. They’ll do our reading, schedule tasks, remind us to take our medications and play our favourite song at just the right time and volume. Machine learning is a fundamental part of enabling robots to perform these activities.

		- Let’s assume that we have been asked to research a problem and make a decision. You must have access to information (data) from which you can learn. Once you have data, what do you do with it? Most people analyse the information to ﬁnd patterns and relationships. You make a decision based on your work. Finally, you evaluate the model. Did you make a good decision or could it have been better?

		- **Data Acquisition** - The ﬁrst step in data manipulation, data acquisition is the process of sampling information that illustrates real world physical conditions with a predeﬁned measurement. Using our car example, you might measure engine size, number of doors, size of tyres etc.

		- **Data Cleaning** - Once the data is properly stored, any redundant, noisy, unusable parts of it should be trimmed. Data cleaning is a major step as real-world datasets are highly affected by noise, redundancy and missing values. We might delete any three-wheeled cars because they’re so unusual.

	- **Analytics** - The second main step in machine learning, analytics mainly involves ﬁnding relationships and correlations in the prepared data in order to design an accurate model based on that input data

	- **Exploratory Data** - in addition, analysis is an approach for analysing datasets in order to summarise their main characteristics or features. Many exploratory data analysis methods use visual illustration of data, based on different features. Things like graphs, charts and tables make data easier to understand.
