			- Consider how humans learn and make decisions. We analyse data, ﬁnd patterns and use those patterns to make decisions or to predict the outcome of future events. For example, if you buy a car, you might look up reviews, check the features of different models, think about how you want to use the car, take some test drives and then make a choice.

It’s as though you have to choose the perfect vehicle for every person at Deakin.

			- Let’s assume that we have been asked to research a problem and make a decision. You must have access to information (data) from which you can learn. Once you have data, what do you do with it? Most people analyse the information to ﬁnd patterns and relationships. You make a decision based on your work. Finally, you evaluate the model. Did you make a good decision or could it have been better?

Data cleaning is a major step as real-world datasets are highly affected by noise, redundancy and missing values. We might delete any three-wheeled cars because they’re so unusual.

We know the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. In other words, we know the ‘right’ answers so we can select, manipulate and reﬁne features to train the machine.

				- **Regression** - Another example of supervised learning, is regression. The overall idea of regression is to examine the relationship between response variables and one or more predictor variables. This examination can result in a hyperplane, representing the regression analysis. The following ﬁgure, illustrates a regression problem in 2 dimensions.

			- **Clustering** - is the process of grouping similar points together. The goal of this unsupervised machine learning technique is to ﬁnd relative similarities in the data points.

					- By performing clustering based on the similarities and correlations, we might ﬁnd 2 clusters in these data points. For example, we might determine trips around the city of less than 25 km and more than 25 km. This creates two groups. The art is in working out if 25 km is a good cut-off point. Is it useful? Perhaps it would be more useful to extract more clusters.

The answer to the question will be ‘True’. We can then ask the machine to put the trip into a cluster containing trips under 25 km. Enter this simple code into your Python setup:

	- An important point to know about matrix addition and subtraction is that it is only defined when $A$ and $B$ are of the same size. Here, both are $2 × 2$. Since operations are performed element by element, these two matrices must be *conformable*; and for addition and subtraction that means they must have the same numbers of rows and columns.
